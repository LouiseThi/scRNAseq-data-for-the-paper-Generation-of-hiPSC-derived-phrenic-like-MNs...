# scRNAseq data-hiPSC-derived-phrenic-like-MNs
Two groups of scRNAseq data (generic vs enriched)for the paper "Generation of human iPSC-derived phrenic-like motor neurons to model respiratory motor neuron degeneration in ALS".
generic corresponds to a culture condition used in many previous studies to generated hiPSC-derived motor neurons cultures
enriched corresponds to a new culture condition developped in the paper "Generation of human iPSC-derived phrenic-like motor neurons to model respiratory motor neuron degeneration in ALS" to obtain hiPSC-derived motor neurons cultures enriched in phrenic motor neurons.
